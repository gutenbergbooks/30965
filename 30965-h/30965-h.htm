<h2>THE ORNITHOLOGICAL CONGRESS.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/imgw.png" width="116" height="80" alt="W" title="" />
</div>
<p>E had the pleasure of
attending the Fifteenth
Congress of the American
Ornithologists&#8217; Union,
which met and held its three days
annual session in the American
Museum of Natural History, New
York City, November 9-11, 1897.
Dr. C. Hart Merriam, of the Department
of Agriculture, Washington
D.C., presided, and there were present
about one hundred and fifty of the
members, resident in nearly all the
states of the Union.</p>

<p>The first paper read was one prepared
by J. C. Merrill, entitled &ldquo;In Memoriam: Charles Emil Bendire.&rdquo;
The character, accomplishments, and
achievements of the deceased, whose
valuable work in biographizing American
birds is so well known to those
interested in ornithology, were referred
to in so appropriate a manner that the
paper, though not elaborate as it is to
be hoped it may ultimately be made,
will no doubt be published for general
circulation. Major Bendire&#8217;s services
to American ornithology are of indisputable
value, and his untimely death
eclipsed to some extent, possibly
wholly, the conclusion of a series of
bird biographies which, so far as they
had appeared, were deemed to be
adequate, if not perfect.</p>

<p>Mr. Frank M. Chapman, the well
known authority on birds, and whose
recent books are valuable additions to
our literature, had, it may be presumed,
a paper to read on the &ldquo;Experiences
of an Ornithologist in Mexico,&rdquo; though
he did not read it. He made, on the
contrary, what seemed to be an
extemporaneous talk, exceedingly
entertaining and sufficiently instructive
to warrant a permanent place for
it in the <em>Auk</em>, of which he is associate
editor. We had the pleasure of examining
the advance sheets of a new book
from his pen, elaborately illustrated in
color, and shortly to be published.
Mr. Chapman is a comparatively
young man, an enthusiastic student and
observer, and destined to be recognized
as one of our most scientific thinkers,
as many of his published pamphlets
already indicate. Our limited space
precludes even a reference to them now.
His remarks were made the more attractive
by the beautiful stuffed specimens
with which he illustrated them.</p>

<p>Prof. Elliott Coues, in an address,
&ldquo;Auduboniana, and Other Matters of
Present Interest,&rdquo; engaged the delighted
attention of the Congress on
the morning of the second day&#8217;s session.
His audience was large. In a biographical
sketch of Audubon the Man,
interspersed with anecdote, he said so
many interesting things that we regret
we omitted to make any notes that
would enable us to indicate at least
something of his characterization. No
doubt just what he said will appear in
an appropriate place. Audubon&#8217;s portfolio,
in which his precious manuscripts
and drawings were so long
religiously kept, which he had carried
with him to London to exhibit to possible
publishers, a book so large that
two men were required to carry it,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
though the great naturalist had used
it as an indispensable and convenient
companion for so many years, was
slowly and we thought reverently
divested by Dr. Coues of its wrappings
and held up to the surprised and grateful
gaze of the spectators. It was
dramatic. Dr. Coues is an actor.
And then came the comedy. He
could not resist the inclination to talk
a little&mdash;not disparagingly, but truthfully,
reading a letter never before
published, of Swainson to Audubon
declining to associate his name with
that of Audubon &ldquo;under the circumstances.&rdquo;
All of which, we apprehend,
will duly find a place on the shelves
of public libraries.</p>

<p>We would ourself like to say
something of Audubon as a man. To
us his life and character have a special
charm. His was a beautiful youth,
like that of Goethe. His love of
nature, for which he was willing to
make, and did make, sacrifices, will
always be inspiring to the youth of
noble and gentle proclivities; his personal
beauty, his humanity, his love-life,
his domestic virtues, enthrall the
ingenuous mind; and his appreciation&mdash;shown
in his beautiful compositions&mdash;of
the valleys of the great river,
<em>La Belle Rivi&egrave;re</em>, through which its
waters, shadowed by the magnificent
forests of Ohio and Kentucky, wandered&mdash;all
of these things have from
youth up shed a sweet fragrance over
his memory and added greatly to our
admiration of and appreciation for the
man.</p>

<p>So many subjects came before the
Congress that we cannot hope to do
more than mention the titles of a few
of them. Mr. Sylvester D. Judd discussed
the question of &ldquo;Protective
Adaptations of insects from an Ornithological
Point of View;&rdquo; Mr. William
C. Rives talked of &ldquo;Summer Birds of
the West Virginia Spruce Belt;&rdquo; Mr.
John N. Clark read a paper entitled
&ldquo;Ten Days among the Birds of Northern
New Hampshire;&rdquo; Harry C. Oberholser
talked extemporaneously of
&ldquo;Liberian Birds,&rdquo; and in a most entertaining
and instructive manner, every
word he said being worthy of large print
and liberal embellishment; Mr. J. A.
Allen, editor of <em>The Auk</em>, said a great
deal that was new and instructive
about the &ldquo;Origin of Bird Migration;&rdquo;
Mr. O. Widmann read an interesting
paper on &ldquo;The Great Roosts on Gabberet
Island, opposite North St. Louis;&rdquo;
J. Harris Reed presented a paper
on &ldquo;The Terns of Gull Island, New York;&rdquo; A. W.
Anthony read of &ldquo;The Petrels of Southern California,&rdquo; and
Mr. George H. Mackay talked interestingly
of &ldquo;The Terns of Penikese Island, Mass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There were other papers of interest
and value. &ldquo;A Naturalist&#8217;s Expedition
to East Africa,&rdquo; by D. G. Elliot, was,
however, the <em>pi&egrave;ce de r&eacute;sistance</em> of the
Congress. The lecture was delivered
in the lecture hall of the Museum, on
Wednesday at 8 p. m. It was illustrated
by stereopticon views, and in
the most remarkable manner. The
pictures were thrown upon an immense
canvas, were marvellously realistic, and
were so much admired by the great
audience, which overflowed the large
lecture hall, that the word demonstrative
does not describe their
enthusiasm. But the lecture! Description,
experience, suffering, adventure,
courage, torrid heat, wild beasts,
poisonous insects, venomous serpents,
half-civilized peoples, thirst,&mdash;almost
enough of torture to justify the use of
Coleridge&#8217;s Ancient Mariner in illustration,&mdash;and
yet a perpetual, quiet,
rollicking, jubilant humor, all-pervading,
and, at the close, on the lecturer&#8217;s
return once more to the beginning of
civilization, the eloquent picture of the
Cross, &ldquo;full high advanced,&rdquo; all combined,
made this lecture, to us, one of
the very few platform addresses entirely
worthy of the significance of unfading
portraiture.</p>

<h2>THE MOUNTAIN BLUEBIRD.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 39px;">
<img src="images/imgi.png" width="39" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div>
<p>N an early number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span> we
presented a picture of the common
Bluebird, which has been
much admired. The mountain
Bluebird, whose beauty is
thought to excel that of his cousin, is
probably known to few of our readers
who live east of the Rocky Mountain
region, though he is a common winter
sojourner in the western part of Kansas,
beginning to arrive there the last
of September, and leaving in March and
April. The habits of these birds of
the central regions are very similar to
those of the eastern, but more wary
and silent. Even their love song is
said to be less loud and musical. It is
a rather feeble, plaintive, monotonous
warble, and their chirp and twittering
notes are weak. They subsist upon
the cedar berries, seeds of plants, grasshoppers,
beetles, and the like, which
they pick up largely upon the ground,
and occasionally scratch for among
the leaves. During the fall and winter
they visit the plains and valleys,
and are usually met with in small
flocks, until the mating season.</p>

<p>Nests of the Mountain Bluebird
have been found in New Mexico and
Colorado, from the foothills to near
timber line, usually in deserted Woodpecker
holes, natural cavities in trees,
fissures in the sides of steep rocky
cliffs, and, in the settlements, in suitable
locations about and in the adobe
buildings. In settled portions of the
west it nests in the cornice of buildings,
under the eaves of porches, in the
nooks and corners of barns and outhouses,
and in boxes provided for its
occupation. Prof. Ridgway found the
Rocky Mountain Bluebird nesting in
Virginia City, Nevada, in June. The
nests were composed almost entirely
of dry grass. In some sections, however,
the inner bark of the cedar enters
largely into their composition. The
eggs are usually five, of a pale greenish-blue.</p>

<p>The females of this species are distinguished
by a greener blue color and
longer wings, and this bird is often
called the Arctic Bluebird. It is emphatically
a bird of the mountains, its visits
to the lower portions of the country
being mainly during winter.</p>

<h2>THE ENGLISH SPARROW.</h2>


<p>&ldquo;Oh, it&#8217;s just a common Sparrow,&rdquo;
I hear Bobbie say to his
mamma, &ldquo;why, I see lots of them
on the street every day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Of course you do, but for all
that you know very little about
me I guess. Some people call
me &ldquo;Hoodlum,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Pest,&rdquo;
and even &ldquo;Rat of the Air.&rdquo; I
hope you don&#8217;t. It is only the
folks who don&#8217;t like me that call
me ugly names.</p>

<p>Why don&#8217;t they like me?</p>

<p>Well, in the first place the city
people, who like fine feathers,
you know, say I am not pretty;
then the farmers, who are not
grateful for the insects I eat, say
I devour the young buds and
vines as well as the ripened
grain. Then the folks who like
birds with fine feathers, and
that can sing like angels, such
as the Martin and the Bluebird
and a host of others, say I drive
them away, back to the forests
where they came from.</p>

<p>Do I do all these things?</p>

<p>I&#8217;m afraid I do. I like to
have my own way. Maybe you
know something about that yourself,
Bobbie. When I choose
a particular tree or place
for myself and family to live in,
I am going to have it if I have
to fight for it. I do chase the
other birds away then, to be
sure.</p>

<p>Oh, no, I don&#8217;t always succeed.
Once I remember a Robin got
the better of me, so did a Catbird,
and another time a Baltimore
Oriole. When I can&#8217;t
whip a bird myself I generally
give a call and a whole troop of
Sparrows will come to my aid.
My, how we do enjoy a fuss like
that!</p>

<p>A bully? Well, yes, if by that
you mean I rule around my own
house, then I <em>am</em> a bully. My
mate has to do just as I say, and
the little Sparrows have to mind
their papa, too.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&#8217;t hurt the little darlings,
papa,&rdquo; says their mother, when it
comes time for them to fly, and
I hop about the nest, scolding
them at the top of my voice.
Then I scold her for daring to
talk to me, and sometimes make
her fly away while I teach the
young ones a thing or two.
Once in a while a little fellow
among them will &ldquo;talk back.&rdquo;
I don&#8217;t mind that though, if he
is a Cock Sparrow and looks
like his papa.</p>

<p>No, we do not sing. We leave
that for the Song Sparrows. We
talk a great deal, though. In
the morning when we get up,
and at night when we go to bed
we chatter a great deal. Indeed
there are people shabby enough
to say that we are great nuisances
about that time.</p>

<h2>THE ENGLISH SPARROW.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HE English Sparrow was first
introduced into the United
States at Brooklyn, New York,
in the years 1851 and &#8217;52.
The trees in our parks were at that
time infested with a canker-worm,
which wrought them great injury, and
to rid the trees of these worms was the
mission of the English Sparrow.</p>

<p>In his native country this bird,
though of a seed-eating family (Finch),
was a great insect eater. The few
which were brought over performed,
at first, the duty required of them;
they devoured the worms and stayed
near the cities. With the change of
climate, however, came a change in
their taste for insects. They made
their home in the country as well as
the cities, and became seed and
vegetable eaters, devouring the young
buds on vines and trees, grass-seed,
oats, rye, and other grains.</p>

<p>Their services in insect-killing are
still not to be despised. A single pair
of these Sparrows, under observation
an entire day, were seen to convey to
their young no less than forty grubs
an hour, an average exceeding three
thousand in the course of a week.
Moreover, even in the autumn he
does not confine himself to grain, but
feeds on various seeds, such as the
dandelion, the sow-thistle, and the
groundsel; all of which plants are
classed as weeds. It has been known,
also, to chase and devour the common
white butterfly, whose caterpillars
make havoc among the garden plants.</p>

<p>The good he may accomplish in
this direction, however, is nullified to
the lovers of the beautiful, by the war
he constantly wages upon our song
birds, destroying their young, and
substituting his unattractive looks and
inharmonious chirps for their beautiful
plumage and soul-inspiring songs.</p>

<p>Mrs. Olive Thorne Miller in &ldquo;Bird Ways&rdquo; gives
a fascinating picture of
the wooing of a pair of Sparrows in a
maple tree, within sight of her city
window, their setting up house-keeping,
domestic quarrel, separation, and
the bringing home, immediately after,
of a new bride by the Cock Sparrow.</p>

<p>She knows him to be a domestic
tryant, a bully in fact, self-willed and
violent, holding out, whatever the
cause of disagreement, till he gets his
own will; that the voices of the females
are less harsh than the males, the
chatter among themselves being quite
soft, as is their &ldquo;baby-talk&rdquo; to the
young brood.</p>

<p>That they delight in a mob we all
know; whether a domestic skirmish or
danger to a nest, how they will all
congregate, chirping, pecking, scolding,
and often fighting in a fierce yet amusing
way! One cannot read these
chapters of Mrs. Miller&#8217;s without agreeing
with Whittier:</p>

<p style="margin-left: 10em;">
&ldquo;Then, smiling to myself, I said,&mdash;<br />
 <span style="margin-left: .3em;">How like are men and birds!&rdquo;</span></p>

<p>Although a hardy bird, braving the
snow and frost of winter, it likes a
warm bed, to which it may retire after
the toils of the day. To this end its
resting place, as well as its nest, is
always stuffed with downy feathers.
Tramp, Hoodlum, Gamin, Rat of the
Air! Notwithstanding these more or
less deserved names, however, one cannot
view a number of homeless Sparrows,
presumably the last brood, seeking
shelter in any corner or crevice
from a winter&#8217;s storm, without a feeling
of deep compassion. The supports
of a porch last winter made but a cold
roosting place for three such wanderers
within sight of our study window, and
never did we behold them, &#8217;mid a
storm of sleet and rain, huddle down
in their cold, ill-protected beds, without
resolving another winter should
see a home prepared for them.</p>

<h2>ALLEN&#8217;S HUMMING BIRD.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 86px;">
<img src="images/imgt.png" width="86" height="80" alt="T" title="" />
</div>
<p>HE Humming birds, with their
varied beauties, constitute
the most remarkable feature
of the bird-life of America.
They have absolutely no representatives
in any other part of the world,
the Swifts being the nearest relatives
they have in other countries. Mr.
Forbes says that they abound most in
mountainous countries, where the surface
and productions of the soil are
most diversified within small areas.
They frequent both open and rare and
inaccessible places, and are often
found on the snowy peaks of Chimborazo
as high as 16,000 feet, and in
the very lowest valleys in the primeval
forests of Brazil, the vast palm-covered
districts of the deltas of the Amazon
and Orinoco, the fertile flats and
savannahs of Demarara, the luxurious
and beautiful region of Xalapa,
(the realm of perpetual sunshine), and
other parts of Mexico. Many of the
highest cones of extinct and existing
volcanoes have also furnished great
numbers of rare species.</p>

<p>These birds are found as small as
a bumble bee and as large as a Sparrow.
The smallest is from Jamaica,
the largest from Patagonia.</p>

<p>Allen&#8217;s Hummer is found on the
Pacific coast, north to British Columbia,
east to southern Arizona.</p>

<p>Mr. Langille,
in &ldquo;Our Birds in their Haunts,&rdquo; beautifully
describes their
flights and manner of feeding. He
says &ldquo;There are many birds the flight
of which is so rapid that the strokes of
their wings cannot be counted, but here
is a species with such nerve of wing
that its wing strokes cannot be seen.
&lsquo;A hazy semi-circle of indistinctness on
each side of the bird is all that is
perceptible.&rsquo; Poised in the air, his
body nearly perpendicular, he seems to
hang in front of the flowers which he
probes so hurriedly, one after the other,
with his long, slender bill. That long,
tubular, fork-shaped tongue may be
sucking up the nectar from those rather
small cylindrical blossoms, or it may
be capturing tiny insects housed away
there. Much more like a large sphynx
moth hovering and humming over
the flowers in the dusky twilight, than
like a bird, appears this delicate, fairy-like
beauty. How the bright green of
the body gleams and glistens in the
sunlight. Each imperceptible stroke
of those tiny wings conforms to the
mechanical laws of flight in all their
subtle complications with an ease and
gracefulness that seems spiritual. Who
can fail to note that fine adjustment of
the organs of flight to aerial elasticity
and gravitation, by which that astonishing
bit of nervous energy can rise and
fall almost on the perpendicular, dart
from side to side, as if by magic, or,
assuming the horizontal position, pass
out of sight like a shooting star? Is it

<h2>THE GREEN-WINGED TEAL.</h2>


<p>Just a common Duck?</p>

<p>No, I&#8217;m not. There is only one
other Duck handsomer than I am, and
he is called the Wood Duck. You
have heard something about him
before. I am a much smaller Duck,
but size doesn&#8217;t count much, I find
when it comes to getting on in the
world&mdash;in <em>our</em> world, that is. I have
seen a Sparrow worry a bird four times
its size, and I expect you have seen a
little boy do the same with a big boy
many a time.</p>

<p>What is the reason I&#8217;m not a common
Duck?</p>

<p>Well, in the first place, I don&#8217;t waddle.
I can walk just as gracefully as I
can swim. Your barn-yard Duck
can&#8217;t do that. I can run, too, without
getting all tangled up in the grass, and
he can&#8217;t do that, either. But sometimes
I don&#8217;t mind associating with
the common Duck. If he lives in a
nice big barn-yard, that has a good
pond, and is fed with plenty of grain,
I visit him quite often.</p>

<p>Where do I generally live?</p>

<p>Well, along the edges of shallow,
grassy waters, where I feed upon
grass, seeds, acorns, grapes, berries, as
well as insects, worms, and small snails.
I walk quite a distance from the water
to get these things, too.</p>

<p>Can I fly?</p>

<p>Indeed I can, and very swiftly. You
can see I am no common Duck when
I can swim, and walk, and fly. <em>You</em>
can&#8217;t do the last, though you can the
first two.</p>

<p>Good to eat?</p>

<p>Well, yes, they say when I feed on
rice and wild oats I am perfectly
delicious. Some birds were, you see,
born to sing, and flit about in the
trees, and look beautiful, while some
were born to have their feathers taken
off, and be roasted, and to look fine
in a big dish on the table. The
Teal Duck is one of those birds. You
see we are useful as well as pretty.
We don&#8217;t mind it much if you eat us
and say, &ldquo;what a fine bird!&rdquo; but
when you call us &ldquo;tough,&rdquo; that hurts
our feelings.</p>

<p>Good for Christmas?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, or any other time&mdash;when
you can catch us! We fly so fast that
it is not easy to do; and can dive
under the water, too, when wounded.</p>

<p>Something about our nests?</p>

<p>Oh, they are built upon the ground,
in a dry tuft of grass and weeds and
lined with feathers. My mate often
plucks the feathers from her own
breast to line it. Sometimes she lays
ten eggs, indeed once she laid sixteen.</p>

<p>Such a family of Ducklings as we
had that year! You should have seen
them swimming after their mother,
and all crying, <em>Quack, quack, quack!</em>
like babies as they were.</p>

<h2>THE GREEN-WINGED TEAL.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/imga1.png" width="93" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;HANDSOME little Duck
indeed is this, well known
to sportsmen, and very
abundant throughout
North America. It is
migratory in its habits, and nests from
Minnesota and New Brunswick northward,
returning southward in winter
to Central America and Cuba.</p>

<p>The green wing is commonly found
in small flocks along the edges of
shallow, grassy waters, feeding largely
upon seeds of grasses, small acorns,
fallen grapes or berries, as well as
aquatic insects, worms, and small snails.
In their search for acorns these ducks
are often found quite a distance from
the water, in exposed situations feeding
largely in the night, resting during
the day upon bogs or small bare spots,
closely surrounded and hidden by
reeds and grasses.</p>

<p>On land this Duck moves with more
ease and grace than any other of its
species except the Wood Duck, and it
can run with considerable speed. In
the water also it moves with great
ease and rapidity, and on the wing it
is one of the swiftest of its tribe. From
the water it rises with a single spring
and so swiftly that it can be struck
only by a very expert marksman;
when wounded it dives readily.</p>

<p>As the Teal is more particular in
the selection of its food than are most
Ducks, its flesh, in consequence, is very
delicious. Audubon says that when
this bird has fed on wild oats at Green
Bay, or soaked rice in the fields of
Georgia or Carolina, it is much superior
to the Canvas back in tenderness,
juiciness, and flavor.</p>

<p>G. Arnold, in the <em>Nidologist</em>, says
while traveling through the northwest
he was surprised to see the number of
Ducks and other wild fowl in close
proximity to the railway tracks. He
found a number of Teal nests within
four feet of the rails of the Canadian
Pacific in Manitoba. The warm,
sun-exposed banks along the railway
tracks, shrouded and covered with
thick grass, afford a very fair protection
for the nests and eggs from
water and marauders of every kind.
As the section men seldom disturbed
them&mdash;not being collectors&mdash;the birds
soon learned to trust them and would
sit on their nests by the hour while the
men worked within a few feet of them.</p>

<p>The green-winged Teal is essentially
a fresh-water bird, rarely being met with
near the sea. Its migrations are over
the land and not along the sea shore.
It has been seen to associate with the
Ducks in a farmer&#8217;s yard or pond and
to come into the barn-yard with tame
fowls and share the corn thrown out
for food.</p>

<p>The nests of the Teal are built upon
the ground, generally in dry tufts of
grass and often quite a distance from
the water. They are made of grass,
and weeds, etc., and lined with down.
In Colorado under a sage brush, a nest
was found which had been scooped in
the sand and lined warmly with down
evidently taken from the bird&#8217;s own
breast, which was plucked nearly bare.
This nest contained ten eggs.</p>

<p>The number of eggs, of a pale buff
color, is usually from eight to twelve,
though frequently sixteen or eighteen
have been found. It is far more prolific
than any of the Ducks resorting
to Hudson&#8217;s Bay, and Mr. Hearn says
he has seen the old ones swimming at
the head of seventeen young when the
latter were not much larger than walnuts.</p>

<p>In autumn the males usually keep
in separate flocks from the females
and young. Their notes are faint and
piping and their wings make a loud
whistling during flight.</p>

<h2>THE BLACK GROUSE.</h2>


<p style="margin-left: 11.5em;">
Alone on English moors I&#8217;ve seen the Black Cock stray,<br />
Sounding his earnest love-note on the air.<br />
               <span style="margin-left: 19em;" class="smcap">&mdash;Anon.</span></p>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/imgw.png" width="116" height="80" alt="W" title="" />
</div>
<p>ELL known as the Black
Cock is supposed to be,
we fancy few of our readers
have ever seen a specimen.
It is a native of the more
southern countries of Europe, and still
survives in many portions of the British
Islands, especially those localities
where the pine woods and heaths afford
it shelter, and it is not driven away by
the presence of human habitation.</p>

<p>The male bird is known to resort at
the beginning of the nesting season to
some open spot, where he utters his
love calls, and displays his new dress
to the greatest advantage, for the purpose
of attracting as many females as
may be willing to consort with him.
His note when thus engaged is loud
and resonant, and can be heard at a
considerable distance. This crowing
sound is accompanied by a harsh,
grating, stridulous kind of cry which
has been compared to the noise produced
by whetting a scythe. The
Black Cock does not pair, but leaves
his numerous mates to the duties of
maternity and follows his own desires
while they prepare their nests, lay
their eggs, hatch them, and bring up
the young. The mother bird, however,
is a fond, watchful parent, and
when she has been alarmed by man or
a prowling beast, has been known to
remove her eggs to some other locality,
where she thinks they will not be
discovered.</p>

<p>The nest is carelessly made of grasses
and stout herbage, on the ground,
under the shelter of grass and bushes.
There are from six to ten eggs of yellowish
gray, with spots of light
brown. The young are fed first upon
insects, and afterwards on berries,
grain, and the buds and shoots of trees.</p>

<p>The Black Grouse is a wild and
wary creature. The old male which
has survived a season or two is particularly
shy and crafty, distrusting both
man and dog, and running away as
soon as he is made aware of approaching
danger.</p>

<p>In the autumn the young males
separate themselves from the other sex
and form a number of little bachelor
establishments of their own, living
together in harmony until the next nesting
season, when they all begin to fall
in love; &ldquo;the apple of discord is
thrown among them by the charms of
the hitherto repudiated sex, and their
rivalries lead them into determined
and continual battles, which do not
cease until the end of the season
restores them to peace and sobriety.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The coloring of the female is quite
different from that of the male Grouse.
Her general color is brown, with a
tinge of orange, barred with black and
speckled with the same hue, the spots
and bars being larger on the breast,
back, and wings, and the feathers on
the breast more or less edged with
white. The total length of the adult
male is about twenty-two inches, and
that of the female from seventeen to
eighteen inches. She also weighs
nearly one-third less than her mate,
and is popularly termed the Heath
Hen.</p>

<h2>THE AMERICAN FLAMINGO.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 39px;">
<img src="images/imgi.png" width="39" height="80" alt="I" title="" />
</div>
<p>N this interesting family of birds
are included seven species, distributed
throughout the tropics.
Five species are American, of
which one reaches our southern
border in Florida. Chapman says
that they are gregarious at all seasons,
are rarely found far from the seacoasts,
and their favorite resorts are shallow
bays or vast mud flats which are
flooded at high water. In feeding the
bill is pressed downward into the
mud, its peculiar shape making the
point turn upward. The ridges along
its sides serve as strainers through
which are forced the sand and mud
taken in with the food.</p>

<p>The Flamingo is resident in the
United States only in the vicinity
of Cape Sable, Florida, where flocks
of sometimes a thousand of these
rosy vermillion creatures are seen.
A wonderful sight indeed. Mr. D.
P. Ingraham spent more or less
of his time for four seasons in the
West Indies among them. He states
that the birds inhabit the shallow
lagoons and bays having soft clayey
bottoms. On the border of these the
nest is made by working the clay up
into a mound which, in the first
season, is perhaps not more than a foot
high and about eight inches in
diameter at the top and fifteen inches
at the base. If the birds are unmolested
they will return to the same
nesting place from year to year, each
season augmenting the nest by the
addition of mud at the top, leaving a
slight depression for the eggs. He
speaks of visiting the nesting grounds
where the birds had nested the previous
year and their mound-like nests were
still standing. The birds nest in June.
The number of eggs is usually two,
sometimes only one and rarely three.
When three are found in a nest it is
generally believed that the third has
been laid by another female.</p>

<p>The stature of this remarkable bird
is nearly five feet, and it weighs in the
flesh six or eight pounds. On the
nest the birds sit with their long legs
doubled under them. The old story
of the Flamingo bestriding its nest
in an ungainly attitude while sitting
is an absurd fiction.</p>

<p>The eggs are elongate-ovate in shape,
with a thick shell, roughened with a
white flakey substance, but bluish
when this is scraped off. It requires
thirty-two days for the eggs to hatch.</p>

<p>The very fine specimen we present
in <span class="smcap">Birds</span> represents the Flamingo
feeding, the upper surface of the
unique bill, which is abruptly bent in
the middle, facing the ground.</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;DAINTY little creature
indeed is the Yellow-headed
Bush Tit, or Verdin, being
smaller than the largest
North American Humming
Bird, which inhabits southern Arizona
and southward. It is a common
bird in suitable localities throughout
the arid regions of Northern
Mexico, the southern portions of Texas,
Arizona, New Mexico, and in Lower
California. In spite of its diminutive
size it builds a remarkable structure
for a nest&mdash;large and bulky, and a
marvel of bird architecture. Davie
says it is comparatively easy to find,
being built near the ends of the
branches of some low, thorny tree or
shrub, and in the numerous varieties
of cacti and thorny bushes which grow
in the regions of its home.</p>

<p>The nest is globular, flask-shaped or
retort shape in form, the outside being
one mass of thorny twigs and stems
interwoven, while the middle is composed
of flower-stems and the lining is
of feathers. The entrance is a small
circular opening. Mr. Atwater says
that the birds occupy the nests during
the winter months. They are generally
found nesting in the high, dry
parts of the country, away from tall
timber, where the thorns are the
thickest. From three to six eggs are
laid, of a bluish or greenish-white or
pale blue, speckled, chiefly round the
larger end, with reddish brown.</p>

<h2>THE BRONZED GRACKLE.</h2>


<p>You can call me the Crow
Blackbird, little folks, if you
want to. People generally call
me by that name.</p>

<p>I look something like the Crow
in the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30103/30103-h/30103-h.htm">March</a> number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>,
don&#8217;t I? My dress is handsomer
than his, though. Indeed
I am said to be a splendid looking
bird, my bronze coat showing
very finely in the trees.</p>

<p>The Crow said <em>Caw, Caw,
Caw!</em> to the little boys and
girls. That was his way of
talking. My voice is not so
harsh as his. I have a note
which some people think is
quite sweet; then my throat
gets rusty and I have some
trouble in finishing my tune. I
puff out my feathers, spread my
wings and tail, then lifting
myself on the perch force out
the other notes of my song.
Maybe you have seen a singer
on the stage, instead of a perch,
do the same thing. Had to get
on his tip-toes to reach a high
note, you know.</p>

<p>Like the Crow I visit the cornfields,
too. In the spring when
the man with the plow turns
over the rich earth, I follow
after and pick up all the grubs
and insects I can find. They
would destroy the young corn
if I didn&#8217;t eat them. Then,
when the corn grows up, I, my
sisters, and my cousins, and my
aunts drop down into the field in
great numbers. Such a picnic
as we do have! The farmers
don&#8217;t seem to like it, but certainly
they ought to pay us for
our work in the spring, don&#8217;t
you think? Then I think
worms as a steady diet are not
good for anybody, not even a
Crow, do you?</p>

<p>We like nuts, too, and little
crayfish which we find on the
edges of ponds. No little boy
among you can beat us in going
a-nutting.</p>

<p>We Grackles are a very
sociable family, and like to visit
about among our neighbors.
Then we hold meetings and all
of us try to talk at once. People
say we are very noisy at such
times, and complain a good deal.
They ought to think of their
own meetings. They do a great
deal of talking at such times, too,
and sometimes break up in a fight.</p>

<p>How do I know? Well, a little
bird told me so.</p>

<p>Yes, we build our nest as other
birds do; ours is not a dainty
affair; any sort of trash mixed
with mud will do for the outside.
The inside we line with
fine dry grass. My mate does
most of the work, while I do the
talking. That is to let the
Robin and other birds know I
am at home, and they better not
come around.<br />

<p>Y the more familiar name
of Crow Blackbird this
fine but unpopular bird is
known, unpopular among
the farmers for his depredations
in their cornfields, though the
good he does in ridding the soil, even
at the harvest season, of noxious
insects and grubs should be set down
to his credit.</p>

<p>The Bronzed Grackle or Western
Crow Blackbird, is a common species
everywhere in its range, from the
Alleghenies and New England north
to Hudson Bay, and west to the Rocky
Mountains. It begins nesting in favorable
seasons as early as the middle
of March, and by the latter part of
April many of the nests are finished.
It nests anywhere in trees or bushes
or boughs, or in hollow limbs or
stumps at any height. A clump of
evergreen trees in a lonely spot is a
favorite site, in sycamore groves along
streams, and in oak woodlands. It is
by no means unusual to see in the
same tree several nests, some saddled
on horizontal branches, others built in
large forks, and others again in holes,
either natural or those made by the
Flicker. A long list of nesting sites
might be given, including Martin-houses,
the sides of Fish Hawk&#8217;s nests,
and in church spires, where the Blackbirds&#8217;
&ldquo;clatterin&#8217;&rdquo; is drowned by the
tolling bell.</p>

<p>The nest is a coarse, bulky affair,
composed of grasses, knotty roots
mixed with mud, and lined with fine
dry grass, horse hair, or sheep&#8217;s wool.
The eggs are light greenish or smoky
blue, with irregular lines, dots and
blotches distributed over the surface.
The eggs average four to six, though
nests have been found containing seven.</p>

<p>The Bronze Grackle is a bird of
many accomplishments. He does not
hop like the ordinary bird, but
imitates the Crow in his stately walk,
says one who has watched him with
interest. He can pick beech nuts,
catch cray fish without getting nipped,
and fish for minnows alongside of any
ten-year-old. While he is flying
straight ahead you do not notice anything
unusual, but as soon as he turns
or wants to alight you see his tail
change from the horizontal to the
vertical&mdash;into a rudder. Hence he is
called keel-tailed.</p>

<p>The Grackle is as omnivorous as the
Crow or Blue Jay, without their sense
of humor, and whenever opportunity
offers will attack and eat smaller birds,
especially the defenseless young. His
own meet with the like fate, a fox
squirrel having been seen to emerge
from a hole in a large dead tree with
a young Blackbird in its mouth. The
Squirrel was attacked by a number
of Blackbirds, who were greatly
excited, but it paid no attention to
their demonstrations and scampered
off into the wood with his prey. Of
their quarrels with Robins and other
birds much might be written. Those
who wish to investigate their remarkable
habits will do well to read the acute
and elaborate observations of Mr.
Lyndes Jones, in a recent Bulletin of
Oberlin College. He has studied for
several seasons the remarkable Bronze
Grackle roost on the college campus
at that place, where thousands of these
birds congregate from year to year,
and, though more or less offensive to
some of the inhabitants, add considerably
to the attractiveness of the
university town.</p>

<h2>THE RING-NECKED PHEASANT.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 116px;">
<img src="images/imgw.png" width="116" height="80" alt="W" title="" />
</div>
<p>E are fortunate in being
able to present our readers
with a genuine specimen
of the Ring-Necked species
of this remarkable family of birds,
as the Ring-Neck has been crossed
with the Mongolian to such an extent,
especially in many parts of the United
States, that they are practically the
same bird now. They are gradually
taking the place of Prairie Chickens,
which are becoming extinct. The
hen will hatch but once each year, and
then in the late spring. She will
hatch a covey of from eighteen to
twenty-two young birds from each setting.
The bird likes a more open
country than the quail, and nests only
in the open fields, although it will
spend much time roaming through
timberland. Their disposition is much
like that of the quail, and at the first
sign of danger they will rush into hiding.
They are handy and swift flyers
and runners. In the western states
they will take the place of the Prairie
Chicken, and in Ohio will succeed the
Quail and common Pheasant.</p>

<p>While they are hardy birds, it is said
that the raising of Mongolian-English
Ring-Necked Pheasants is no easy
task. The hens do not make
regular nests, but lay their eggs on the
ground of the coops, where they are
picked up and placed in a patent box,
which turns the eggs over daily.
After the breeding season the male
birds are turned into large parks until
February.</p>

<p>The experiment which is now being
made in Ohio&mdash;if it can be properly so
termed, thousands of birds having been
liberated and begun to increase&mdash;has
excited wide-spread interest. A few
years ago the Ohio Fish and Game
Commission, after hearing of the great
success of Judge Denny, of Portland,
Oregon, in rearing these birds in that
state, decided it would be time and
money well spent if they should devote
their attention and an &ldquo;appropriation&rdquo;
to breeding and rearing these attractive
game birds. And the citizens of that
state are taking proper measures to see
that they are protected. Recently
more than two thousand Pheasants
were shipped to various counties of the
state, where the natural conditions are
favorable, and where the commission
has the assurance that the public will
organize for the purpose of protecting
the Pheasants. A law has been enacted
forbidding the killing of the birds
until November 15, 1900. Two hundred
pairs liberated last year increased
to over two thousand. When not
molested the increase is rapid. If the
same degree of success is met with
between now and 1900, with the strict
enforcement of the game laws, Ohio
will be well stocked with Pheasants in
a few years. They will prove a great
benefit to the farmers, and will more
than recompense them for the little
grain they may take from the fields in
destroying bugs and insects that are
now agents of destruction to the growing
crops.</p>

<p>The first birds were secured by Mr.
E. H. Shorb, of Van Wert, Ohio, from
Mr. Verner De Guise, of Rahway, N. J.
A pair of Mongolian Pheasants, and a
pair of English Ring-Necks were
secured from the Wyandache Club,
Smithtown, L. I. These birds were
crossed, thus producing the English
Ring-Neck Mongolian Pheasants,
which are larger and better birds, and
by introducing the old English Ring-Neck
blood, a bird was produced that
does not wander, as the thoroughbred
Mongolian Pheasant does.</p>

<p>Such of our readers as appreciate
the beauty and quality of this superb
specimen will no doubt wish to have
it framed for the embellishment of the
dining room.</p>

grass-seed to his mate where she sits low down amongst the docks

<h2>THE YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT.</h2>


<p>I am often heard, but seldom
seen. If I were a little boy or a
little girl, grown people would
tell me I should be seen and not
heard. That&#8217;s the difference
between you and a bird like me,
you see.</p>

<p>It would repay you to make
my acquaintance. I am such a
jolly bird. Sometimes I get all
the dogs in my neighborhood
howling by whistling just like
their masters. Another time I
mew like a cat, then again I give
some soft sweet notes different
from those of any bird you ever
heard.</p>

<p>In the spring, when my mate
and I begin house-keeping, I do
some very funny things, like the
clown in a circus. I feel so
happy that I go up a tree branch
by branch, by short flights and
jumps, till I get to the very top.
Then I launch myself in the air,
as a boy dives when he goes
swimming, and you would laugh
to see me flirting my tail, and
dangling my legs, coming down
into the thicket by odd jerks and
motions.</p>

<p>It really is so funny that I
burst out laughing myself, saying,
<em>chatter-chatter, chat-chat-chat-chat!</em>
I change my tune sometimes,
and it sounds like <em>who
who</em>, and <em>tea-boy</em>.</p>

<p>You must be cautious though,
if you want to see me go through
my performance. Even when I
am doing those funny things in
the air I have an eye out for
my enemies. Should I see you
I would hide myself in the
bushes and as long as you were
in sight I would be angry and
say <em>chut, chut!</em> as cross as
could be.</p>

<p>Have I any other name?</p>

<p>Yes, I am called the Yellow
Mockingbird. But that name
belongs to another. His picture
was in the <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/files/30666/30666-h/30666-h.htm">June</a> number of <span class="smcap">Birds</span>,
so you know something about
him. They say I imitate other
birds as he does. But I do
more than that. I can throw my
voice in one place, while I am in
another.</p>

<p>It is a great trick, and I get
lots of sport out of it.</p>

<p>Do you know what that trick
is called? If not, ask your
papa. It is such a long word I
am afraid to use it.</p>

<p>About my nest?</p>

<p>Oh, yes, I am coming to that.
I arrive in this country about
May 1, and leave for the south
in the winter. My nest is nothing
to boast of; rather big, made
of leaves, bark, and dead twigs,
and lined with fine grasses and
fibrous roots. My mate lays
eggs, white in color, and our
little ones are, like their papa,
very handsome.</p>

<h2>THE YELLOW-BREASTED CHAT.</h2>

<div class="figleft" style="width: 93px;">
<img src="images/imga1.png" width="93" height="80" alt="A" title="" />
</div>
<p>&nbsp;COMMON name for this
bird, the largest of the warblers,
is the Yellow Mockingbird.
It is found in the
eastern United States,
north to the Connecticut Valley and
Great Lakes; west to the border of the
Great Plains; and in winter in eastern
Mexico and Guatemala. It frequents
the borders of thickets, briar patches,
or wherever there is a low, dense
growth of bushes&mdash;the thornier and
more impenetrable the better.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After an acquaintance of many years,&rdquo; says
Frank M. Chapman, &ldquo;I
frankly confess that the character of
the Yellow-Crested Chat is a mystery
to me. While listening to his strange
medley and watching his peculiar
actions, we are certainly justified in
calling him eccentric, but that there
is a method in his madness no one who
studies him can doubt.&rdquo;</p>

<p>By many observers this bird is
dubbed clown or harlequin, so peculiar
are his antics or somersaults in the air;
and by others &ldquo;mischief maker,&rdquo;
because of his ventriloquistic and
imitating powers, and the variety of his
notes. In the latter direction he is
surpassed only by the Mockingbird.</p>

<p>The mewing of a cat, the barking of
a dog, and the whistling sound produced
by a Duck&#8217;s wings when flying,
though much louder, are common
imitations with him. The last can
be perfectly imitated by a good
whistler, bringing the bird instantly to
the spot, where he will dodge in and
out among the bushes, uttering, if the
whistling be repeated, a deep toned
emphatic <em>tac</em>, or hollow, resonant
<em>meow</em>.</p>

<p>In the mating season he is the noisiest
bird in the woods. At this time
he may be observed in his wonderful
aerial evolutions, dangling his legs
and flirting his tail, singing vociferously
the while&mdash;a sweet song different
from all his jests and jeers&mdash;and
descending by odd jerks to the thicket.
After a few weeks he abandons these
clown-like maneuvers and becomes a
shy, suspicious haunter of the depths
of the thicket, contenting himself in
taunting, teasing, and misleading, by
his variety of calls, any bird, beast, or
human creature within hearing.</p>

<p>All these notes are uttered with
vehemence, and with such strange and
various modulations as to appear near
or distant, in the manner of a ventriloquist.
In mild weather, during
moonlight nights, his notes are heard
regularly, as though the performer
were disputing with the echoes of his
own voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I ought to be ashamed to
confess it,&rdquo; says Mr. Bradford Torrey,
after a visit to the Senate and House
of Representatives at Washington,
&ldquo;but after all, the congressman in
feathers interested me most. I thought
indeed, that the <em>Chat</em> might well
enough have been elected to the lower
house. His volubility and waggish
manners would have made him quite
at home in that assembly, while his
orange colored waistcoat would have
given him an agreeable conspicuity.
But, to be sure, he would have needed
to learn the use of tobacco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The nest of the Chat is built in a
thicket, usually in a thorny bush or
thick vine five feet above the ground.
It is bulky, composed exteriorly of dry
leaves, strips of loose grape vine bark,
and similar materials, and lined with
fine grasses and fibrous roots. The
eggs are three to five in number, glossy
white, thickly spotted with various
shades of rich, reddish brown and
lilac; some specimens however have
a greenish tinge, and others a pale
pink.</p>
